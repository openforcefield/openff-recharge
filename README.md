OpenFF Recharge is a framework which aims to provide utilities for optimising the partial charges of molecules against 
QC derived electrostatic potential and electric field data.
 
Currently, the framework focuses on the optimization of bond-charge correction (BCC) and virtual site parameters.

***Warning** - although a significant effort has been made to ensure the scientific validity of this framework 
(especially the hand-converted AM1BCC parameters), it is still under heavy development and much care should be taken 
when using it in production work.*

## Getting Started

To start using this framework we recommend looking over [the documentation](https://openff-recharge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),
especially the [installation](https://openff-recharge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation.html) and 
[quick start](https://openff-recharge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/quick-start.html) guides.
