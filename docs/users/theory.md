# Theory

This page aims to outline the key theoretical aspects of the framework, ranging from how the supported charge models are
applied to molecules up to how the framework constructs the objective ( / loss) functions used to train them.

## Supported charge models

A key feature of this framework is being able to apply different types of charge model to a molecule. There are 
currently three types of parameter available based upon the [SMIRNOFF] specification: library charges, bond charge
corrections, and virtual sites.

(library_charge_section)=
### Library charges 

A library charge is used to assign a set of specific partial charges to each atom in a molecule. It is a combination of 
a fully indexed SMILES pattern that describes the molecule the charges should be applied to, and a set of charges to 
apply to each atom in that SMILES pattern. A collection of these can be stored in a flat vector 

$$ \mathbf{p}_{lib} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
     p_{1, 1} & \dots & p_{1, n_1} & \dots & p_{\gamma_{lib}, 1} & p_{\gamma_{lib}, n_{\gamma_{lib}}} \\
  \end{bmatrix}^\intercal
$$ 

where here $\gamma_{lib}$ is the total number of library parameters in the model, $n_i$ is the number of atoms in the 
molecule represented by parameter $i$, and $p_{i, j}$ corresponds to the charge associated with atom $j$ in the molecule 
represented by parameter $i$.

### Bond charge corrections

A bond charge correction (BCC) is used to perturb the charge on two atoms involved in a given bond by an equal but 
opposite amount {cite}`jakalian2000fast,jakalian2002fast` such that the total charge on the molecule remains the same. 
It is a combination of a SMIRKS pattern that has exactly two bonded atoms tagged with an index (e.g. `[#6:1]-[#1:2]`) 
and the value of the charge correction to apply. A collection of these can be stored in a flat vector

$$ \mathbf{p}_{bcc} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
     p_{1} & \dots & p_{\gamma_{bcc}} \\
  \end{bmatrix}^\intercal
$$

where here $\gamma_{bcc}$ denotes the number of BCC parameters in the model and $p_i$ corresponds to the $i$'th BCC 
parameter.

The value of the charge correction will be added to the first indexed atom matched by the SMIRKS pattern, while the 
same value of the charge correction but with an opposite sign will be added to the second indexed atom matched by the 
SMIRKS pattern.

### Virtual sites

A virtual site (v-site) parameter is used to create a dummy particle on a molecule that is positioned relative to a 
number of parent atoms and carries a slight partial charge. Such particles are useful for, for example, representing
lone pairs of electrons or sigma holes that are not well represented by charges localised on atom centers. 

:::{note}
All 'types' of virtual site that are defined by the [SMIRNOFF] specification, (bond charge and mono-, di-, and trivalent 
lone pair types) are supported within OpenFF Recharge.
:::

Unlike the other two parameter types, a virtual site is a combination of both a set of charge increment values that 
shift charge from a parent atom onto the virtual site *and* a set of parameters that describe where the virtual site 
should be placed relative to the parent atoms.

Like the other parameter types we can store the charge increments in a flat vector

$$ \mathbf{p}_{v\text{-}site} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
     p_{1, 1} & \dots & p_{1, n_1} & \dots & p_{\gamma_{v\text{-}site}, 1} & p_{\gamma_{v\text{-}site}, n_{\gamma_{v\text{-}site}}} \\
  \end{bmatrix}^\intercal
$$ 

where here $\gamma_{v\text{-}site}$ is the total number of v-site parameters in the model, $n_i$ is the number of parent atoms 
that v-site parameter $i$ will be positioned relative to, and $p_{i, j}$ corresponds to the charge that will be added 
to parent atom $j$ and subtracted from the total v-site charge.

The coordinate parameters that must be provided will depend on the type of virtual site to be placed, but will include 
at least one of a distance $d$, out-of-plane angle $\theta$, and in-plane-angle $\psi$ defined 
relative to the parent atoms.

#### Generating coordinates

The coordinates of a virtual site are generated by constructing a 'local coordinate frame' from the coordinates of the 
atoms the virtual site will be placed relative to.

In particular, the local coordinate frame is composed of an origin $\mathbf{o}$, and three orthonormal directions 
$\mathbf{\hat{x}}$, $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$, and $\mathbf{\hat{z}}$. For a given set of atomic coordinates $\mathbf{r}^{atom}_1, \dots, \mathbf{r}^{atom}_n$, we can
construct each component [according to](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory/05_other_features.html#virtual-sites)

$$
    \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{o} \\ \mathbf{dx} \\ \mathbf{dy} \end{bmatrix} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{w}_o \\ \mathbf{w}_x \\ \mathbf{w}_y\end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{r}_1^{atom} \\ \vdots \\ \mathbf{r}_n^{atom}\end{bmatrix}
$$

and

$$
    \begin{aligned} 
        \mathbf{dz} &= \mathbf{dx} \times \mathbf{dy} \\
        \mathbf{\hat{z}} &= \dfrac{\mathbf{dz}}{\left|\mathbf{dz}\right|} \\
        \mathbf{\hat{x}} &= \dfrac{\mathbf{dx}}{\left|\mathbf{dx}\right|} \\
        \mathbf{\hat{y}} &= \mathbf{z} \times \mathbf{x}
    \end{aligned}
$$

where here $\mathbf{W} = \begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{w_o} & \mathbf{w_x} & \mathbf{w_y}\end{bmatrix}^\intercal$ is a matrix of weights 
unique to each type of virtual site, as can be seen in the table below.

|                          | **N Parent Atoms** |                                                          **W**                                                           |
|--------------------------|:------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **Bond Charge**          |         2          |                            $\begin{bmatrix}\phantom{-}1 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 \\ -1 & 1\end{bmatrix}$                            |
| **Monovalent Lone Pair** |         3          |                      $\begin{bmatrix}\phantom{-}1 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$                      |
| **Divalent Lone Pair**   |         3          |            $\begin{bmatrix}0 & \phantom{-}1 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{2} & -1 & \frac{1}{2} \\ 1 & -1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$            |
| **Trivalent Lone Pair**  |         4          | $\begin{bmatrix}0 & \phantom{-}1 & 0 & 0 \\ \frac{1}{3} & -1 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \\ 1 & -1 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$ |

The coordinates of the virtual site $\mathbf{r^{v\text{-}site}}$ is positioned by projecting the virtual site coordinate 
parameters, which are defined in spherical coordinates, onto this frame according to

$$
    \mathbf{r}^{v\text{-}site} = \mathbf{o} + d \left(\cos\theta\cos\phi \mathbf{\hat{x}} + \sin\theta\cos\phi \mathbf{\hat{y}} + \sin\phi \mathbf{\hat{z}} \right)
$$

The full set of coordinates for the molecule thus becomes 

$$\mathbf{r} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{r}^{atom} \\ \mathbf{r}^{v\text{-}site}\end{bmatrix}$$

(applying_models_section)=
## Applying charge models

In general, the vectors of charge parameters described above can be applied to a given molecule through the construction
of an *assignment matrix* {cite}`jakalian2000fast`. The assignment matrix

$$
    \mathbf{T}_{\square}=\begin{bmatrix}
      T_{1,1} & \dots  & T_{1,\gamma_{\square}} \\
      \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
      T_{N,1} & \dots. & T_{N,\gamma_{\square}} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
$$

is a matrix that yields a vector of partial charges on each atom in a molecule when right multiplied by a flat vector of 
charge parameters as described above

$$ \mathbf{q}_{\square} = \mathbf{T}_{\square}\mathbf{p}_{\square} $$

where $N$ is the number of atoms and $\gamma_{\square}$ the number of charge parameters of type $\square$. 

In the case of library charges the assignment must have exactly one entry of 1 in each row while in contrast, for bond 
charge correction parameters the assigment matrix can have any entries so long as the sum of each column is 0 is 
satisfied. This ensures that the total charge on the molecule will remain 0 after the BCCs have been applied.

For a given charge model that is some combination of library charges, BCCs, and v-sites the total charge on a molecule
will be

$$ 
\mathbf{q}^{atom} = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{p} = 
                 \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{T}_{lib} & \mathbf{T}_{bcc} & \mathbf{T}_{v\text{-}site} \end{bmatrix} 
                 \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{p}_{lib} \\ \mathbf{p}_{bcc} \\ \mathbf{p}_{v\text{-}site} \end{bmatrix}
$$

Alternatively a model may not contain any library charge parameters, such as the AM1BCC charge model, opting to instead
derive a base set of charges $q_{base}$, to be perturbed from some QM calculation. In such a case, the total charge will
instead be

$$ 
\mathbf{q}^{atom} = \mathbf{q}_{base} + \mathbf{T}\mathbf{p} = 
                   \mathbf{q}_{base}
                 + \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{T}_{bcc} & \mathbf{T}_{v\text{-}site} \end{bmatrix} 
                   \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{p}_{bcc} \\ \mathbf{p}_{v\text{-}site} \end{bmatrix}

$$

If the charge model contains virtual site parameters, the charge on each virtual site is similarly computed by applying 
an assignment matrix $\mathbf{S}_{v\text{-}site}$ to the vector of v-site parameters

$$ \mathbf{q}^{v\text{-}site} = \mathbf{S}_{v\text{-}site}\mathbf{p}_{v\text{-}site} $$

The full set of charges for the molecule thus becomes 

$$\mathbf{q} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{q}^{atom} \\ \mathbf{q}^{v\text{-}site} \end{bmatrix}$$

(train_to_qc_section)=
## Training to electronic property data

The charge parameters described above can be trained against electronic property data, namely the electrostatic 
potential (ESP) and the electric field computed on a grid of points, by constructing an objective ( / loss) function
to be minimized in the usual ways.

In particular, the calculated electronic property of interest $O\left(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{r}\right)$ can be inserted into the standard
least squares (L2) loss function such that 

$$
    \Delta = \sum^K_{i=1}\left||O_{ref,i} - O\left(\mathbf{q_i},\mathbf{r_i}\right)\right||^2
$$

where the summation is over $K$ molecules in a given conformation, $O_{ref}$ is the target value of the electronic 
property computed using some reference (normally an accurate QM) method, and $\mathbf{q}_i$ and $\mathbf{r}_i$ are the
charge and coordinates (including both atom and v-site values) of molecule $i$ .

The value of $O$ can be written more generally as $O\left(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{r}\right) = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{q}$. In the 
case of training against ESP data that has been computed on a grid of $M$ points

$$
    \mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{1}{|\mathbf{d}_{1,1}|} & \dots  & \dfrac{1}{|\mathbf{d}_{1,N}|} \\
    \vdots                                 & \ddots & \vdots                                  \\
    \dfrac{1}{|\mathbf{d}_{M,1}|} & \dots. & \dfrac{1}{|\mathbf{d}_{M,N}|} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where $\mathbf{d}_{i,j}$ is the a vector from atom $j$ to grid point $i$, while when training against electric field data

$$
    \mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\mathbf{\hat{d}}_{1,1}}{|\mathbf{d}_{1,1}|} & \dots  & \dfrac{\mathbf{\hat{d}}_{1,N}}{|\mathbf{d}_{1,N}|} \\
    \vdots                                 & \ddots & \vdots                                  \\
    \dfrac{\mathbf{\hat{d}}_{M,1}}{|\mathbf{d}_{M,1}|} & \dots. & \dfrac{\mathbf{\hat{d}}_{M,N}}{|\mathbf{d}_{M,N}|} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Adopting the language of [regression analysis], we define the **design matrix** as the combination of 
$\mathbf{X}$ and the assignment matrix:

$$
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{T}
$$

such that

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}
$$

forms the system of equations that must be solved to find the values of our charge parameters where here
$\mathbf{b}=O\left(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{r}\right)$ or if using fixed base charges rather than library charges

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{X}\mathbf{q}_{base}
$$

In cases where observables have been computed for multiple molecules in multiple conformers, we can simply combine
the individual design matrices and observable vectors for molecule $i$ in conformer $j$ as

$$
\mathbf{A} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{A}_{11} \\ \mathbf{A}_{12} \\ \vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{b} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    \mathbf{b}_{11} \\ \mathbf{b}_{12} \\ \vdots \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
