    Notes
    -----
    This function is not currently vectorised but may be in the future.

    Parameters
    ----------

        The second list of points with shape=(n_points_b, n_dim).

    Returns
    -------
        The squared distance matrix where ``d_ij = 1.0 / sqrt((a_i - b_i) ^ 2)``
        with shape=(n_points_a, n_points_b).
