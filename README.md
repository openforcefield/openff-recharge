OpenFF Recharge is an framework which provides utilities for optimising the partial charges of molecules against electrostatic potential data through the use of bond-charge corrections (BCC).

**Warning** - although a significant effort has been made to ensure the scientific validity of this framework (especially the hand-converted AM1BCC parameters), it is still under heavy development and much care should be taken when using it in production work.
